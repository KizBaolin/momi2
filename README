TODO:

next steps:

general cleanup, reorganization, removal of dead files

***
make ms_path an option to pass in
use -r in examples

***

clean up TODO's in examples

***
remove all TODO (grep for it)

***
assert no monomorphic configs in compute_sfs

***
GPU support

***
numpy parallel support/testing
make einsum2 use tensordot (it is faster and more parallelizable/GPU-friendly)

***
in examples, replace imports with just "import momi"

have setup.py install momi

***

Missing data support

***

ancient DNA support

***

change SCRM_PATH to MS_PATH

***
Make autodifferentiation work for functional size history
allow functional size history to be passed in with ms style cmd

***
put things into __init__

***
find minimal example test case for autograd issue #24

***
for simulate_sfs, make theta=None work when -r is set

(or at least have it raise an exception)

or get rid of theta=None altogether

***
add back from __future__ import division

***
tau = inf in ExponentialHistory currently disabled because it breaks automatic differentiation
