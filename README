TODO:

next steps:

general cleanup, reorganization, removal of dead files

***
write a nice README


***

test using ms instead of scrm for examples and tests
use -r in examples


***
remove all TODO (grep for it)

***
GPU support

***
numpy parallel support/testing
make einsum2 use tensordot (it is faster and more parallelizable/GPU-friendly)

***
in examples, replace imports with just "import momi"

have setup.py install momi

***

Missing data support

***

ancient DNA support

***
Make autodifferentiation work for functional size history
allow functional size history to be passed in with ms style cmd

***
put things into __init__

***
find minimal example test case for autograd issue #24

***
get rid of theta=None option for simulations (so one less dependency)

***
add back from __future__ import division

***
tau = inf in ExponentialHistory currently disabled because it breaks automatic differentiation
