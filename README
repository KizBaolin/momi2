TODO:

next steps:


***

TEST sfs and etjj is exactly off by factor of 2.0
after I rescaled to ms units

***
get rid of all calls to eval!!!
(it is not safe)

***
let pop indices in ms command also be variables
(so that it is easier to construct ms commands with splits)

create an example.py with a simple (no) exponential growth, and a 4 pop model with migration (where the pop labels might vary)

***
use new Hessian, Hessian_vector_product wrappers in autograd

***
remove all TODO (grep for it)

***

change SCRM_PATH to MS_PATH

***

test what parameter of EPSILON is needed for log_likelihood_prf
(perhaps by starting out optimizer in very unlikely position)

also visually look how many 0s occur, and for what sorts of configs

***
add an "ms_cmd" property to Demography

***
rename test_basinhopping. (turn it into example.py?)

***
Make autodifferentiation work for functional size history
allow functional size history to be passed in with ms style cmd

***
put things into __init__

***
find minimal example test case for autograd issue #24

***
merge some of my_functions into autograd package with pull request

***
for simulate_sfs, make theta=None work when -r is set

(or at least have it raise an exception)

***
add option to simulate from ms instead of scrm

***
store sumCounts, sumSqCounts, nonzeroCounts in a single object?
OR
name it sfs_counts, sq_counts, nonzero_counts instead

***
add back from __future__ import division

***
get rid of Demography.from_newick
get rid of from_newick, to_newick in parse_ms

***
tau = inf in ExponentialHistory currently disabled because it breaks automatic differentiation
