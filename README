TODO:

next steps:

general cleanup, reorganization, removal of dead files

***
move test demographies to their own file
(or have an example_demographies be accessible through __init__)

***

write example_sfs.py
clean up TODO's in examples

***
get rid of all calls to eval!!!
(it is not safe)

***
remove all TODO (grep for it)


***

add back EPSILON to deal with underflow issues in log likelihood
add a default. only use it if necessary. in that event, output a warning.

basically have it work GRACEFULLY with minimal effort from user

test what parameter of EPSILON is needed for log_likelihood_prf
(perhaps by starting out optimizer in very unlikely position)

also visually look how many 0s occur, and for what sorts of configs


***
don't require user to figure out which population is indexed where...

allow a new variable convention, e.g. #2.1 is the first population that split from 2?
(but what if we have multiple splits off same pop?)
OR
either preprocess the input
OR
(
let ms command take in arbitrary variable names with $ sign
have them be passed in as **kwargs
AND
set $ signs for -es populations automatically
to handle -es, whether it has a $pop or not,
use
_es(t,i,p,splitpop=None,**kwargs)
)

***
GPU support

***

Missing data support

***

archaic DNA support

***

change SCRM_PATH to MS_PATH

***
Make autodifferentiation work for functional size history
allow functional size history to be passed in with ms style cmd

***
put things into __init__

***
find minimal example test case for autograd issue #24

***
merge some of my_functions into autograd package with pull request

***
for simulate_sfs, make theta=None work when -r is set

(or at least have it raise an exception)

***
add option to simulate from ms instead of scrm

***
add back from __future__ import division

***
tau = inf in ExponentialHistory currently disabled because it breaks automatic differentiation
