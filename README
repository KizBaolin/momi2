TODO:

next steps:

***
let pop indices in ms command also be variables
(so that it is easier to construct ms commands with splits)

create an example.py with a simple (no) exponential growth, and a 4 pop model with migration (where the pop labels might vary)

***
remove all TODO (grep for it)

***
change sfs format in log_likelihood_prf to dictionary

***
Make autodifferentiation work for functional size history
allow functional size history to be passed in with ms style cmd

***
put things into __init__

***
find minimal example test case for autograd issue #24

***
merge some of my_functions into autograd package with pull request

***
for simulate_sfs, make theta=None work when -r is set
(right now it counts up the total branch length, but doesn't know
how to deal with multiple trees)

***
add option to simulate from ms instead of scrm

***
store sumCounts, sumSqCounts, nonzeroCounts in a single object?

***
change everything to be in ms units

***
add back from __future__ import division

***
get rid of Demography.from_newick
get rid of from_newick, to_newick in parse_ms

***
tau = inf in ExponentialHistory currently disabled because it breaks automatic differentiation
