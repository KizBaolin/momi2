TODO:

***
do some speed testing, to see how much autodifferentiation slows stuff down
compare:
1. previous implementation (before adarray)
2. constant case (no derivatives)
3. first order derivatives
4. second order derivatives

***
compare which version of expm_multiply is faster (with and without derivatives)

***
get all population size histories working again!

***
get all unit tests working again. clean them up a bit if necessary

****
in adarray, make __pow__ work for arrays, for at least some cases
(e.g. if raising an array to a constant power -- having x**-1 would be nice)
in adarray, implement logical_or, logical_and

after above two changes, do cleanup in size_history, removing array() and num.x calls where possible

***
implement expm_multiply in adarray

***
implement only tracking first-order derivatives in adarray

***
make adarray be able to merge back into original project easily

to do this, instead of using ADF class, change ADF to be abstract superclass
old-ad ADF becomes ADScalar
my new ADF becomes ADArray
whenever ADF arithmetic returns something, it calls self.getAD(result) to make
the result be of appropriate type, where ADScalar and ADArray each return their own
getAD

***
make size_history store the SFS as an array,
instead of having sum_product have to convert to an array everytime
