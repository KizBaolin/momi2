To build for conda, do:

   conda build conda/ -c defaults -c conda-forge -c bioconda


Note that defaults channel MUST be higher priority than conda-forge! Else, conda build will use the wrong C compiler, and we get errors on Linux like:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
gcc: error: unrecognized command line option ‘-fstack-protector-strong’
gcc: error: unrecognized command line option ‘-fno-plt’
error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1
#+END_EXAMPLE

These links sort of explain the issue:

https://conda-forge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/meta.html#compilers

HOWEVER, mixing the ~defaults~ and ~conda-forge~ in this way is not really recommended.
It would be desirable to switch over to using ~conda-forge~ as the highest priority (for example, this is what Bioconda recommends).
The following link might help us to get the ~conda-forge~ C compilers working:

This reference is also useful for explaining on conda ~defaults~ build things:
