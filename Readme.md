This repository implements the algorithm and results in this [paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01133).
In particular, it computes the expected joint site frequency spectrum for a tree-shaped demography without migration.

An upcoming paper and software package will extend this algorithm to handle demographic historieswith pulse migration, and
will also include a method for fitting models via gradient descent.
