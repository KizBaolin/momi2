# momi

This repository implements the algorithm and results in the following [paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01133).
In particular, it computes the expected joint site frequency spectrum for a tree-shaped demography without migration.

An upcoming paper and software package will implement the full momi algorithm, with pulse migration, and
statistical inference via gradient descent.
