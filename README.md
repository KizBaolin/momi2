# momi

momi (MOran Models for Inference) is a Python package that computes
the expected sample frequency spectrum (SFS), a statistic commonly used
in population genetics, and uses it to fit demographic history.

See the [documentation](http://momi2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
for installation instructions, tutorial, and API reference.
A preprint describing the method in detail will be released soon.
