TODO:

***
replace cached_property module (v1.0.0 not compatible with using nx.DiGraph)
***
make state of derived counts, a property of SumProduct, instead of Demography
***
don't make n_max a field of size_history;
instead have etjj and sfs take n as a parameter, and return
the appropriate vector
***
make exponential size history work with growth rate 0
