write pydocs
write docstrings for parse_ms, demography, __init__
change likelihood docs/signatures to use mu instead of theta
in make_demography docstring, add a section "Comments" that discusses some time scaling issues. but otherwise just assume everything is in per-generation units

change make_demography to demo_from_ms, demography
change unlinked_log_likelihood and simulate_ms to use mu instead of theta
change to_ms_cmd and simulate_ms to take in a scale_time or gens_per_time parameter

rename make_demography to demo_from_ms, and replace most calls to it to use the new format
remove # symbol from ms command lines

rewrite example_sfs.py
make sure to check str(demo) returns something that looks like the original ms cmd (in terms of indexing and flags after -es)

rewrite example_inference.py
# first create demos without params. then compute statistics. then compute sfs.
# then simulate with ms. then compute log likelihood.
# then create demos with params. then do mle search 0
# then create demos with params in a differentiable way. have probabilities be in logit scale for illustration. then do mle search 1.
# then do confidence intervals, etc.
functions to compute marginal p-values and Wald tests. (include these in See Also of composite_mle_approx_covariance)
add verbose option to unlinked_mle_search1 and unlinked_mle_search2

write unlinked_mle_search0 that doesn't use derivatives (for demo functions that are not differentiable)
in comments for unlinked_mle_search1,2,etc note that the function must only use operations that are differentiable by autograd!
write something in docs about what makes a function differentiable (at least, "see the tutorial for discussion of autograd differentiation")

rename files (likelihood_surace.py should just be likelihood.py, sum_product should be compute_sfs.py)

fix installation scripts
make scikit-tensor dependency optional?

clean up simulate_inference.py
have simulate_inference use callback instead of f_verbose
clean up tensor.py

reorganize tests; in particular have some utility functions for creating demographies, and other useful things for many tests
also clean up things like log_within(), etc.
rename test_sims to test_ms?
write tests for tensor surfaces
