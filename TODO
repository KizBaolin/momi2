Finish writing documentation!!

util.py
* have read_sfs_list,write_sfs_list format include line for sample size
   * also remove -n flag from Demography?
     sample sizes 'belong' with SFS, not the demography
     at least when reading in data & specifying parametric model
* function for simple slsqp inference
  * use Demography construction to automatically build constraints
  * need to implement InvalidDemographyException, to return float('inf') when out of bounds
* optimize()
  * there is a confusion between iteration number from POV of the optimizer,
    which may not be the same as the number of function evaluations,
    and the iteration number from POV of util.optimize(), which
    is the number of function evaluations (when printing)

Demography
* documentation of -P flag
* store constraints when constructing Demography (for use in slsqp)
* don't make Demography subclass of networkx.DiGraph anymore
* clean up construction code
* class InvalidDemographyException
* in docs, add section "Comments" to discuss time scaling issues
* note Demography.from_ms equivalent to Demography("-msformat ...")
* remove -a,# modifications to Demography.from_ms()? (undecided)
