rename raw_compute_sfs to expected_sfs_tensordot, and sfs_projection to observed_sfs_tensordot or empirical_sfs_tensordot or just sfs_tensordot
rename compute_sfs to expected_sfs

use tuple/list instead of dictionary for raw_compute_sfs and sfs_projection
make sure everything is 0-indexed

have branch_len be its own function (rather than returned with compute_sfs)

remove min_freqs from compute_sfs (but keep it for branch_len function)

fix installation scripts
make scikit-tensor dependency optional?

clean up simulate_inference.py
have simulate_inference use callback instead of f_verbose
clean up tensor.py

rewrite example_inference.py
functions to compute marginal p-values and Wald tests. (include these in See Also of composite_mle_approx_covariance)

require make_demography to have all differentiable parameters specified with $

what should be name of demography leaves? maybe "leaf0", "leaf1", etc?
reorganize parse_ms.py and demography.py
