write pydocs

rename compute_sfs to expected_sfs
have branch_len be its own function (rather than returned with compute_sfs)
remove min_freqs from compute_sfs (but keep it for branch_len function)

add verbose option to unlinked_mle_search1 and unlinked_mle_search2

rewrite example_inference.py
functions to compute marginal p-values and Wald tests. (include these in See Also of composite_mle_approx_covariance)

rename files (likelihood_surace.py should just be likelihood.py, sum_product should be compute_sfs.py)

fix installation scripts
make scikit-tensor dependency optional?

clean up simulate_inference.py
have simulate_inference use callback instead of f_verbose
clean up tensor.py

make sure expected_sfs works for just a single config

reorganize tests; in particular have some utility functions for creating demographies, and other useful things for many tests
