Finish writing documentation!!

util.py
* have read_sfs_list,write_sfs_list format include line for sample size
   * also remove -n flag from Demography?
     sample sizes 'belong' with SFS, not the demography
     at least when reading in data & specifying parametric model
* function that takes in Demography command and starting position, and does slsqp inference


Demography
* store constraints when constructing Demography (for use in slsqp)
* don't make Demography subclass of networkx.DiGraph anymore
* clean up construction code
* class InvalidDemographyException
* in docs, add section "Comments" to discuss time scaling issues
* note Demography.from_ms equivalent to Demography("-msformat ...")
* remove -a,# modifications to Demography.from_ms()? (undecided)
