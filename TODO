write pydocs
write docstrings for parse_ms, Demography, __init__
in Demography docstring, add a section "Comments" that discusses some time scaling issues. but otherwise just assume everything is in per-generation units


either put ms in git repository, or make scrm a subpackage of the git repository
install it in installation script, and use it as default
(so don't have to rely on system variable $MS_PATH)


remove make_demography
in docstring, note Demography.from_ms is equivalent to using Demography("-ms $%d %s" % (len(args), ms_cmd), *(args + [default_N_diploid]), **kwargs)
reference "help(Demography.from_ms)" in description of "-ms_cmd" flag in Demography docstring
remove # sign and -a flags from ms demographies


rename files (likelihood_surace.py should just be likelihood.py, sum_product should be compute_sfs.py)

don't make Demography a subclass of networkx.DiGraph:
it allows users to make changes to the graph,
and also clutters up the documentation

clean up Demography construction code

make InvalidDemographyException

fix installation scripts
make scikit-tensor dependency optional?

clean up simulate_inference.py
have simulate_inference use callback instead of f_verbose
clean up tensor.py

reorganize tests; in particular have some utility functions for creating demographies, and other useful things for many tests
also clean up things like log_within(), etc.
rename test_sims to test_ms?
write tests for tensor surfaces

turn tutorial.py into ipython notebook

write test to check expected_tmrca (simulate from ms, and check the TMRCA's of the trees)
