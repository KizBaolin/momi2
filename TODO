Finish writing documentation!!

util.py
0. have read_sfs_list,write_sfs_list format include line for sample size
   * also remove -n flag from Demography?
     sample sizes 'belong' with SFS, not the demography
     at least when reading in data & specifying parametric model

Demography
0. don't make Demography subclass of networkx.DiGraph anymore
1. clean up construction code
2. class InvalidDemographyException
3. in docs, add section "Comments" to discuss time scaling issues
4. note Demography.from_ms equivalent to Demography("-msformat ...")
5. remove -a,# modifications to Demography.from_ms()? (undecided)

tensor.py
0. restore commented code

examples/tutorial.py
0. ipython notebook?

tests/test_tmrca.py
0. check against ms -T

parse_ms.py
0. -T functionality

likelihood.py
0. sparse matrix for counts_ij in unlinked_log_lik_vector()

compute_sfs.py
0. built in functionality for missing alleles
