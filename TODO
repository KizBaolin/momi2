change time scaling back to coalescent scaling (use option scale_time=2.0 in make_ms_demography)

rename make_demography to demo_from_ms, and replace most calls to it to use the new format

rewrite example_sfs.py
make sure to check str(demo) returns something that looks like the original ms cmd (in terms of indexing and flags after -es)

rewrite example_inference.py
functions to compute marginal p-values and Wald tests. (include these in See Also of composite_mle_approx_covariance)
add verbose option to unlinked_mle_search1 and unlinked_mle_search2

rename files (likelihood_surace.py should just be likelihood.py, sum_product should be compute_sfs.py)

fix installation scripts
make scikit-tensor dependency optional?

clean up simulate_inference.py
have simulate_inference use callback instead of f_verbose
clean up tensor.py

reorganize tests; in particular have some utility functions for creating demographies, and other useful things for many tests
also clean up things like log_within(), etc.

write tests for tensor surfaces
