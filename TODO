write pydocs
write docstrings for parse_ms, demography, __init__
change likelihood docs/signatures to use mu instead of theta
in make_demography docstring, add a section "Comments" that discusses some time scaling issues. but otherwise just assume everything is in per-generation units


Demography constructor is broken if events are not in sorted order!
To fix this:
in the constructor:
remember the population labels/order
sort the events by time
process the event in sorted order


remove make_demography
in docstring, note Demography.from_ms is equivalent to using Demography("-ms $%d %s" % (len(args), ms_cmd), *(args + [default_N_diploid]), **kwargs)
reference "help(demo_from_ms_cmd)" in description of "-ms_cmd" flag in Demography docstring


change unlinked_log_likelihood and simulate_ms to use mu instead of theta
change to_ms_cmd and simulate_ms to take in a scale_time or gens_per_time parameter

rename make_demography to demo_from_ms, and replace most calls to it to use the new format
remove # symbol from ms command lines

finish writing tutorial.py.
delete example_sfs.py and example_inference.py

functions to compute marginal p-values and Wald tests. (include these in See Also of composite_mle_approx_covariance)

write unlinked_mle_search0 that doesn't use derivatives (for demo functions that are not differentiable)
in comments for unlinked_mle_search1,2,etc note that the function must only use operations that are differentiable by autograd!
write something in docs about what makes a function differentiable (at least, "see the tutorial for discussion of autograd differentiation")

rename files (likelihood_surace.py should just be likelihood.py, sum_product should be compute_sfs.py)

don't make Demography a subclass of networkx.DiGraph:
it allows users to make changes to the graph,
and also clutters up the documentation

clean up Demography construction code


fix installation scripts
make scikit-tensor dependency optional?

clean up simulate_inference.py
have simulate_inference use callback instead of f_verbose
clean up tensor.py

reorganize tests; in particular have some utility functions for creating demographies, and other useful things for many tests
also clean up things like log_within(), etc.
rename test_sims to test_ms?
write tests for tensor surfaces
