move tensor stuff (including L2 error) into own file
make scikit-tensor dependency optional?
fix installation scripts
use tuple/list instead of dictionary for raw_compute_sfs and sfs_projection
make sure everything is 0-indexed
rename raw_compute_sfs to sfs_projection
write pydocs
have branch_len be its own function (rather than returned with compute_sfs)
remove min_freqs from compute_sfs
rename aggregate_sfs to sum_sfs_list
rewrite example_inference.py
clean up simulate_inference.py
clean up tensor.py
functions to compute marginal p-values and Wald tests. (include these in See Also of composite_mle_approx_covariance)
have simulate_inference use callback instead of f_verbose
require make_demography to have all differentiable parameters specified with $
