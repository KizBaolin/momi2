write a new make_demography, that uses standard coalescent scaling and populations indexed by 0
# new format will have following options:
# -s (== -es), -j (== -ej), -n (== -en), -g (== -en)
# -g t * == -eG t, -n t * == -eN t
# -N == default population size
# -D == -I
make everything internally use standard coalescent scaling
keep old make_demography as make_demography_ms
# Steps:
# make some tests use ms command line to simulate directly, to make sure demography_from_ms is correct
# have function that takes ms command line, sorts it by time, replaces flag names, then pass it on to new make_demography, with options to scale_time=2.0 and add_pop_idx=1

in the meantime, if the above new make_demography is too much:
# just rename old make_demography to make_demography_ms
# change to coalescent scaling; change leaf indexing to 0-based
# in documentation/tutorial, note deficiencies of make_demography_ms,
# note new make_demography format is upcoming

rewrite example_sfs.py

rewrite example_inference.py
functions to compute marginal p-values and Wald tests. (include these in See Also of composite_mle_approx_covariance)
add verbose option to unlinked_mle_search1 and unlinked_mle_search2

rename files (likelihood_surace.py should just be likelihood.py, sum_product should be compute_sfs.py)

fix installation scripts
make scikit-tensor dependency optional?

clean up simulate_inference.py
have simulate_inference use callback instead of f_verbose
clean up tensor.py

reorganize tests; in particular have some utility functions for creating demographies, and other useful things for many tests
also clean up things like log_within(), etc.

write tests for tensor surfaces
