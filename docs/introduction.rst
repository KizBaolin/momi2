**momi** (MOran Models for Inference) is a Python package that computes
the expected sample frequency spectrum (SFS), a statistic commonly used
in population genetics, and uses it to fit demographic history.

The code is on `github <https://github.com/jackkamm/momi2>`_, and a preprint
describing the method can be found on `bioRxiv <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/23/287268>`_.
